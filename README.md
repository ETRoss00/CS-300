# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem was to design and implement a software application that allows academic advisors to easily access and manage course information for the Computer Science department at ABCU. The solution needed to read course data from a file, store it efficiently, and provide functionalities to query and display this information.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by first understanding the requirements and designing the application using appropriate data structures. I chose a binary search tree (BST) for efficient storage and retrieval of course information based on course numbers. Understanding data structures was very important as it allowed me to select the best way to organize and manipulate the data, making sure that the application was both efficient and scalable.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I encountered several roadblocks, such as issues with file handling, ensuring the correct format of the input data, and dealing with edge cases. I overcame these challenges by methodically debugging the code, adding detailed error messages, and researching best practices for handling file input/output in C++. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has significantly expanded my understanding of software design and development. I learned the importance of planning and designing the data structures before diving into coding. This approach helped me create a more organized and maintainable codebase. I also gained experience in writing modular code, which is easier to debug and test.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Working on this project has emphasized the importance of writing clean, readable, and well-documented code. I have learned to use inline comments and meaningful variable names to make the code more understandable. Additionally, implementing error handling and validating user input have made the program more robust and user-friendly. These practices ensure that the code is maintainable and adaptable for future modifications and enhancements.
